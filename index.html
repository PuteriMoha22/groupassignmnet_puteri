      <p>While most of us are familiar with pizzas, have you wondered how it was invented?</p>
      <p>The history of pizza goes back to the Neolithic era, when people ate flatbreads that were baked in the oven and topped with different foods. But it wasn't until the 1600s that bakers in Naples, Italy, made the first dish that we now call pizza. At the time, it was sold as "food for the poor" in Naples.</p>
      <p>In the 1800s, when King Umberto I and Queen Margherita came to visit Italy, pizza's reputation changed for the better. The story goes that Queen Margherita got sick of eating French food all the time and asked to try different kinds of pizza. Raffaele Esposito, a baker at Da Pietro Pizzeria (now called Pizzeria Brandi), made a pie for the queen with red tomato sauce, white mozzarella, and green basil. It's called "Margherita pizza" now.</p>
      <p>In the late 1800s, when Italians started moving to other countries and bringing their recipes and food with them, pizza became popular all over the world. Soon, there were lots of pizzerias all over the world, and each one had its own special dishes. Because of this long history, there are now many kinds of pizza in Malaysia. Italian pizza is the most popular.</p>
      <p>When we think of good Italian pizza in Malaysia, we think of CROSTATATA PIZZA.
